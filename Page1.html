                <h1>Hello, I'm Boo Jian Hao</h1>
                <p>I'm a first year Cybersecurity student. Currently xpursuing my CyberSecurity and Digital Forensics diploma at Nanyang Polytechnic, I have been actively involved in learning and applying cybersecurity principles to real-world scenarios.</p>
                My journey into cybersecurity began with my fascination with the complexities of digital security and the ever-evolving nature of cyber threats. Through my coursework and hands-on projects, I have developed a decent foundation in Cybersecurity
                <p>What drives me is the challenge of staying ahead of emerging threats and ensuring that organizations can operate securely in an increasingly digital world. I am committed to continuous learning and adapting to new technologies and methodologies to provide the best defense against cyber attacks.</p>
                <p>Throughout my academic career, I have had the privilege of working on various projects, including [Highlight a Notable Project or Achievement]. These experiences have not only sharpened my skills but also underscored the importance of proactive and comprehensive security strategies.</p>
